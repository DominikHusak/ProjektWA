        Bitcoin was first described in a white paper released in 2008 and published under

        open source software2. The Bitcoin network is a worldwide network of computers that run Bitcoin software.      </div>

      Bitcoin mining is the mechanism by which participants on the Bitcoin network reach 
      consensus regarding the next block of transactions to add to the Bitcoin blockchain. 
      For each new block, certain people called “miners” race with one another to find a 
      solution to a cryptographic puzzle. The first miner to find a solution gets to propose 
      the new block of transactions to the entire network. As a reward, the winning miner of 
      the block gets newly created bitcoin. Thus, mining is also the process by which new 
      bitcoin are introduced into the system.      </div>

      Bitcoin is an open source project, with no official entity controlling the Bitcoin network. 
      Anyone can review Bitcoin’s code and propose changes. There are many compatible versions 
      of Bitcoin network software, but a distribution of the software known as “Bitcoin Core” is 
      currently the most widely adopted and provides the de facto standard for the Bitcoin protocol.

      Cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized network, which means it lacks a centralized authority. 
      Crypto holders can perform transactions without actually revealing their identities, which is 
      why the market gained a reputation to be a hub for illegal practitioners. But, the blockchain 
      network publicly records every transaction. These transactions or payments can be traced back 
      to a crypto exchange that can identify the end-users.
