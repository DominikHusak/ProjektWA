      <h4 id="list-item-1">What is Crypto</h4>
      <p>Cryptocurrency, or crypto for short, is a digital or virtual form of money that is secured using 
        cryptography. It is a decentralized system that enables secure and anonymous transactions directly 
        between individual network participants, without the need for an intermediary such as a bank or 
        payment gateway. Cryptocurrencies utilize blockchain technology, which is a distributed public 
        ledger system that records all transactions and ensures their immutability. The most well-known 
        cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, but there are many others, such as Ethereum, Ripple, or Litecoin. 
        Cryptocurrencies offer the potential for fast and inexpensive transactions, investment 
        opportunities, and also drive innovation in the fields of finance and technology.</p>

      <h4 id="list-item-2">What makes the price</h4>
      <p>The value of cryptocurrencies is determined by several factors. One of the main factors is 
        supply and demand in the market. When there is increasing interest in a particular cryptocurrency 
        and more people are willing to buy it, the price tends to rise. Conversely, if the demand 
        decreases and people sell their cryptocurrencies, the price falls. Another factor influencing 
        value is investor trust. If a cryptocurrency gains support from institutional investors or is 
        adopted on a larger scale, it can strengthen its value. The growth and development of 
        cryptocurrency technology, such as scalability improvements and enhanced security, can also 
        contribute to value appreciation. However, it is important to recognize that cryptocurrency 
        value can be highly volatile, and investing in them carries significant risk.</p>

      <h4 id="list-item-3">Types of Crypto</h4>
      <p>There is a wide range of cryptocurrencies in existence. Bitcoin, the first and most 
        well-known cryptocurrency, operates on a decentralized payment system. Ethereum, another 
        prominent cryptocurrency, focuses on supporting smart contracts and decentralized applications. 
        Other popular cryptocurrencies include Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Cardano. Each of 
        these cryptocurrencies has its own specific features, technologies, and focus, offering 
        various opportunities for investment and utilization in different areas.</p>
