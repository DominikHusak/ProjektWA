## How to install and run

1. First you need to install Xampp if you don't have it already.
2. You also need to download ZIP file of the project.
3. After you have downloaded the project file you will find the "xampp" directory where is a directory called "htdocs" into which you will put the downloaded files.
4. It is important to put the files that are in the downloaded ZIP file into the htdocs directory so that htdocs contains the files containing the project code and not another directory with the files.
5. Once the project is in the htdocs directory, open the XAMPP Control Panel" and start Apache and MySQL.
6. Then just type "127.0.0.1" or "localhost/" into your web browser and you will be redirect to Home page.
